        <p> 
          After deciding to pursue a career change into software development in mid 2019, 
          I have become enthralled with the breadth of powerful new languages and libraries 
          that have come about in just the last ten years. 
          <br/><br/>

          Currently, I am all about React, TypeScript and CSS5.</p>

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p> JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Python, SQL</p>

          <h2>Other Interests/Skills</h2>
          <p> Die Hard DIYer, Music Production, Construction, Brewing</p>

    </div>
